# Creating Smart Contracts

## Background

We use the Truffle Suite under-the-covers in vscode to develop smart contracts in Ethereum with Azure. Remember: Before choosing the implementation language, one has to design the flow and develop conditions. You should have a basic understanding of this from our ideation session.  

## Getting Started

Make sure you have followed the steps in [EnvironmentSetup.md](EnvironmentSetup.md)

* Ctl+Shft+P:  `Blockchain: New Solidity Contract`
* `Create basic project`
* give it a path.  I'm using `solidity-contract`
* the project will take a few mins to create
* You should see something like this in your explorer pane:

This is our smart contract code template.  Take a minute to familiarize yourself with the contents of the folder.
