You don't own bitcoin b/c ownership implies that the legal system can exact penalties on another party.  How would this be done when bitcoin is spread across a worldwide network?  How would this be enforced without a split?  So maybe you don't own bitcoin but rather "hold" bitcoin?  

## Gini coefficient
In economics is a measure of inequality.  Bitcoin is estimated to be .88 meaning bitcoin wealth is consolidated into a few big holders.  


## Transactions

At peak, Bitcoin can process 7 transactions per second (TPS); Ethereum tops out around 30. In contrast, Visa and MasterCard boast tens of thousands of TPS at their peaks. In proof- of- stake (PoS), miners are replaced by validators. Swapping out the SHA-256 proof-of-work consensus algorithm for a PoS algorithm could greatly reduce block times, helping Ethereum to increase throughput beyond even Visa and MasterCardâ€™s limits.
