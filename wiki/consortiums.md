Let's look at consortiums through the lens of a use case: healthcare solutions.  

Everyone agrees that:

* technology is and will be critical to solving structural healthcare issues like improving delivery and curbing costs. 
* health care should be centered on the individual consumer patient rather than the corporate interest. 
  * there is a killer app that can solve much of this that has yet to be found
* the fee-for-service marketplace lacks any sort of rational, free-market characteristics and no one seems to know how to inject these principles into the structure
* we aren't getting our money's worth out of the system.  

All (most) parties in the system agree with the above and each has a vested interest in seeing workable fixes. All parties who understand blockchain agree that it has the potential to be the digital disruptor.  It can lay the foundation for leaner, more agile care delivery models, payment systems, value chains, and consumer experiences.  These parties and counter-parties need to form a `consortium` to achieve the goals.  

Change needs to start with the most interested and affected party:  the consumer.  One reason blockchain is an enabler of
disruption in health care lies in its potential to change the consumer’s relationship with existing systems of health and wellness. It provides an alternative to today’s corporate-focused environment that has become a limiting factor for society. Users will interact with this new model through their mobile devices, which will leverage “wallet” software that will become more and more self-sovereign over time. 

Consumers have to "plug-in" to systems of care today.  In the future the system-of-care will plug into the blockchain to interact with the consumer.  Data sharing will not be determined by providers but by the consumer who is the ultimate owner of all data.  This can be done without cumbersome regulations like HIPAA.  

The providers and payers will jump at the opportunity to participate because part of blockchain's value prop is removing manual processes and redundancies from the system.  These 3rd parties will not need to abandon their databases and processes.  They can simply interact with the blockchain via APIs.  As will connected medical devices, wearables, and IoMT.  

For all of this to work there needs to be consortia to get critical mass and network affects.   

## Who might be the members of a healthcare consortium?

These parties all have a vested interest in the system 

* provider and patient identity systems
* payments
* IoT (clinical and supply chain)
* disease registries
* clinical trials
* EMR/EHR 
* revenue cycle products
* ERP/CRM systems

These parties can help fund blockchain initiatives by membership dues, technical research, and hosting.
