# Blockchain Hackathon

## Abstract

Companies in every industry are building blockchain applications and asking their business partners to integrate with them.  Are you ready to build a blockchain application when your CEO comes asking?  Blockchain is transforming forward-thinking companies.  Now is the time to understand the technology and build a strategy. 

This is a full day session geared to both business leaders and technologists.  We begin by briefly discussing what blockchain is and what are good and bad use cases.  We will split into teams to discuss a business use case applicable to any industry.  The remainder of the day will be hacking and coding our solution, geared to developers and data professionals.  

**This is a hands-on hackathon.  You will need a computer with the ability to install software (linux, mac, windows is acceptable).  You do not need to have previous blockchain or coding experience.  You will also need access to an Azure subscription to spin up the blockchain solution.**

(If you would like a general introduction to blockchain please see [my Blockchain wiki](./wiki/README.md) which contains my learning notes).  

## What is this Hackathon all about?

We hope at the end of the day you'll learn the following:

* Understand the basics of blockchain (the technology is changing so fast that few people are experts)
* Understand good and bad use cases for blockchain
* Understand the technologies underlying the Azure Blockchain portfolio
* Build a little blockchain app using common patterns.  

## **Getting Your Environment Setup**

**Please follow the instructions on [EnvironmentSetup.md](EnvironmentSetup.md).  You may want to start doing this immediately.  Installing software can take valuable time away from hacking.**
